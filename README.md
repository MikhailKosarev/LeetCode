# LeetCode
My goal is to be proficient in basic data structures and algorithms, because that's the way to comfortably solve complex problems.

Here you can find my solutions to some LeetCode problems. Sometimes I solve a problem the straightforward way and then try to refactor it in a more efficient or readable way. So there can be several solutions for one problem. For some solutions, I leave comments to help others grasp the thought process of the solution.

For all problems, I provide an evaluation of the temporal complexity.
